parallel="none", thread-count="2"
parallel="false", thread-count="2"
-> When parallel="none"/ parallel="false", then TestNg will consider sequential execution irrespective of the thread-count.

parallel="tests", thread-count="1"
-> This will create only one thread and execute Tests with single Thread, This is also example of sequential execution.

thread-count can not be negative value. It will throw and exception - illegalArgumentException.

parallel="instance" -> This is used when @Factory annotations are used.

parallel="tests"/"methods"/"classes" are most commonly used.

parallel="tests" thread-count="2"
-> whenever thread-count > 1 then its parallel execution. In this case, test tag from the testng.xml file will be executed parallel with 2 tests at one time.
so if u have t1, t2, t3 tests, then t1 and t2 will be executed first and t3 will have to wait till any one thread is free. Then the free thread will
pick t3 test and start execution.
